Solar System - Explore the Planets

Welcome to the Solar System - Explore the Planets app! ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ
This web app allows you to explore the fascinating planets in our solar system with fun facts, orbital velocity calculations, and more! Each planet has its own unique features, from its orbital characteristics to fun trivia. Additionally, enjoy interactive animations and cool effects as you learn about each planet.

Features:
Planet Exploration: Click on each planet's name to learn about its orbital velocity, eccentricity, and other fun facts.
Travel Time Calculation: Calculate how long it would take to travel between two cities at the orbital speed of each planet.
Planet Fun Facts: Get a random fun fact every time you click on a planet.
Interactive Background: The background changes dynamically based on the selected planet.
Cool Animations: Enjoy transition effects and animations like fiery heading text and starry footer text for an immersive experience.
